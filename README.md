# Volt::Awesome

Awesome UI for @VoltFramework applications, based on Bootstrap 3.3.0 and Font Awesome.

Blocks of ui can be created with a few simple lines, such as `<:awesome:panel:image title="My headline" image_url="src.png" />`

example from an app done at a hackathon:

![screenshot volt awesome ui](https://github.com/heri/volt-awesome/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true "screenshot volt::awesome")


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'volt-awesome'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install volt-awesome

## Usage

View the app/awesome/views folder to view all possible UI blocks.
